    \begin{itemize}
        \item ``The tablet app worked very well in the field and I would be keen to continue using it for subsequent sampling'' -- New Zealand Soil Geochemistry
        \item ``Being able to check in on everyone's work from my computer so easily is... revolutionary. Thank you for building such an amazing tool! …  I look forward to providing more details, but I already feel like I have 100\%{} better control over data quality, even compared to last year'' -- Proyecto Arquelogico de Zana Colonial
        \item ``The app has been such an incredible advantage in terms of workload, data quality, and a number of other data management issues with which archaeologists regularly have to deal. It readily links disparate data types that are otherwise stored separately – such as photographs, tabular logs, and context relationships.'' -- Malawi Early-Middle Stone Age Project
        \item ``I was really impressed with the approach FAIMS project has taken to the challenge of creating field data apps which can be very expensive. Our module was ready for testing after just one briefing.'' -- Streamwatch
        \item ``We’re back from the field and I cannot believe how well everything went. ... [T]he combination of the mobile lab, the sample ID/tracking and FAIMS application enabled us to average 5-6 minutes per sample site (crust, soil, rock and two plants)  in the field and about half that in the lab... Using the old school notepad and GPS approach this would have been 15 mins at best and a whole lot of misplaced photos and details, not to mention the additional hours entering the data in at night. We were able to identify missed sites as we went and completed the soils map (280 sites) and infill (36 sites) and analysis all in the 7 days. '' -- CSIRO Mineral Resources

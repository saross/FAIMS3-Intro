  abstract = {FAIMS Mobile is a native Android application supported by an Ubuntu server facilitating human-mediated field research across disciplines. It consists of `core' Java and Ruby software providing a platform for data capture, which can be deeply customised using `definition packets' consisting of XML documents (data schema and UI) and Beanshell scripts (automation). Definition packets can also be generated using an XML-based domain-specific language, making customisation easier. FAIMS Mobile includes features allowing rich and efficient data capture tailored to the needs of fieldwork. It also promotes synthetic research and improves transparency and reproducibility through the production of comprehensive datasets that can be mapped to vocabularies or ontologies as they are created.},

  abstract = {This chapter summarises the experience acquired by the Federated Archaeological Information Management Systems (FAIMS) project over the course of developing open-source software for archaeologists. open-source software development, which excels at coordinating discrete contributions from many people and organisations, ooers the best hope for producing complex and expensive tools in a discipline where resources are limited. Over the course of this project, we have come to realise that open-source approaches have applications in archaeological research beyond the development of software itself. The development of redeployable eld recording systems, which must be exible and robust in order to accommodate the diversity of archaeological data, represent one such application. FAIMS project software facilitates this type of development by separating the (large and complicated) application code from the (relatively simple and largely human-readable) document les that customise the application for use by a particular project. Distributed version control systems like GitHub, which are already being used for texts and documents beyond code, provide a capable platform for coordinating peer production of these deenition documents. FAIMS has used GitHub successfully for its internal development of early-adopter eld projects over the last year, demonstrating its potential. Just as open-source approaches have improved software by bringing the insights of an entire community to bear on diicult problems, eld recording systems-as well as the methods and approaches they embody also beneet from the transparency provided by wide distribution and collaboration facilitated by version control systems.},

A National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources (NeCTAR)-funded initiative, the FAIMS project aims to develop tools to facilitate the creation, sharing, reuse and dissemination of high-quality digital datasets for research and cultural heritage management. FAIMS has engaged in an extensive stocktaking and liaison programme with archaeologists and related professionals, the results of which have shaped the development plans. Project development is focusing on highly customisable mobile applications for data collection, a web application for data processing, and an online repository for archiving and disseminating data, with provisions for creating semantically and technically compatible datasets embedded throughout. Data exchange using standard formats and approaches ensures that components work well together, and that new, externally developed tools can be added later. Our goal is to create a digital system that respects the current workflow of archaeological practice, improves the availability of compatible archaeological data, and delivers features that archaeologists want to use.},

We first review existing Android GIS applications and discuss their performance and suitability for archaeological fieldwork in remote locations, before presenting the lessons of this review for FAIMS mobile application development. We then discuss the variety of Australian archaeological practice, suggesting how semantically compatible datasets may be produced from diverse sources at the time of data creation. Finally, we introduce the data structure underlying our mobile application, which accommodates a wide range of practices and data models while promoting syntactic and semantic dataset compatibility.},

Three field directors report their experiences adapting FAIMS software to projects in Turkey, Malawi, and Peru, highlighting three themes: (1) the transition from paper to digital recording has upfront costs with backend pay-off, (2) the transition involves decisions and tradeoffs that archaeologists and technologists need to make together, and (3) digital recording has both short- and long-term benefits. In the short-term, project directors reported efficient acquisition of richer, more accurate, data. Longer-term, they anticipated that the availability of comprehensive, born-digital datasets would support rigorous demonstration of field intuitions and faster publication of more complete datasets. We argue that cooperative development involving archaeologists and technologists can produce high-quality, fit-for-purpose software, representing the best chance to embedding new technology in established projects.},

This article explores the difficulties that surround data reuse in large-scale regional research, including the cost and coordination necessary to extract useful data from digitized PDF reports. The amount of correction and enhancement matches the effort needed to undertake a small field survey project and can only be circumvented with a thoughtful application of computer-assisted text analysis. Missing data in excavation report PDFs are not only intractable but also insidious due to their concealed nature, leading to poor outcomes in terms of (re)use. Consequently, the degree of data reuse in archaeology has been overestimated.},

  abstract = {The Capricorn hydrogeochemistry study builds on previous work in the Yilgarn Craton, creating a seamless dataset that covers much of Western Australia. This study has developed a provisional review of the mineral prospectivity of the region using groundwater geochemistry, defining areas of interest requiring further investigation. In the Capricorn, groundwater samples were collected from 1035 wells and bores, in most cases the water table was within 20 m of the surface. Samples were also taken from known mineral deposits to provide examples of the geochemical signature associated with mineralisation in the region. Field measurements included pH, Eh, EC and temperature. Separate field prepared sub-samples were collected for cation, anion, alkalinity, and Au/PGE analysis. Robust statistical methods were applied to combine bailed and flowing samples using a derived contamination factor that is tailored to the individual measured parameters. Rescaling normal or log-normal data and the creation of indices for lithology discrimination, Au, U and sulfide mineralisation improved the utility of hydrogeochemical data. All samples were analysed for δ18O, δ2H and selected samples were analysed for δ34S and associated δ18O from SO42. A number of different parameters can be used to indicate rock types from hydrogeochemical data even when there is deep weathering or transported cover. Higher dissolved concentrations of elements can indicate mafic (Cr, V) or granitic (U, F) rocks and ratios between elements (e.g. K excess, relative to Rb) can differentiate between granitic and sedimentary terrains. These determinations are improved by multi-element indices. The work tests the utility of previously derived mineral exploration indices, and has resulted in the creation of new indices designed for the geology of the Capricorn Orogen. Hydrogeochemical exploration for Au using Au, Ag, As and combined element indices such as AuMin was able to delineate areas of known mineralisation and target new areas of interest. The FeS index developed in the north Yilgarn Craton did not prove to be very effective in the Capricorn, but the AcidS index has anomalism linked to most of the known deposits and provides new areas of interest. There are several areas in the Capricorn that have U concentrations greater than those in close proximity to known deposits in the north Yilgarn. Spatially, the carnotite saturation index predicts most of the known U prospects and provides new targets in the Capricorn. The utility of groundwater as a sample medium able to `see through' cover was tested in two case study regions. In the Bryah Basin, groundwater possesses the chemical signature of mafic rocks but due to the thickness of transported cover soil sample chemistry does not reflect the underlying lithologies. At the polymetallic Abra deposit groundwater possesses anomalous Pb and W concentrations related to the buried deposit, whilst soil samples are proven to be an ineffective at targeting mineralisation. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes highlight groundwater samples that have a composition suggestive of a water source other than meteoric water. This water source has mixed with meteoric water and may be linked to faults, mineralisation or hydrothermal alteration. Light δ34S values and associated light δ18O successfully identified mineralisation at Paulsens Au deposit and have the potential to target new areas of mineralisation. This research further demonstrates the value of groundwater chemistry for defining lithology, hydrothermal alteration and mineralisation in areas with and without cover. Stable isotopes have been used systematically across the region to assist in delineating new areas of interest.},

However, it did not improve data consistency between users and yielded a classificatory system that was somewhat more challenging to update than our previous mode of operation. These results underscore some of the trade-offs that may be entailed in employing mobile technologies for archaeological applications and highlight the ways in which specific media configurations impact the production of archaeological knowledge.},
